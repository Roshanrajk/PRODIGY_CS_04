ðŸ”’ Task Completed: Simple Keylogger Script in Python for Educational Purposes! ðŸ”’

I'm excited to share that I've successfully developed a keylogger script in Python. This script demonstrates the fundamentals of keylogging and is intended solely for educational purposes.

Key Features:

Keystroke Logging: Captures and logs keystrokes in real-time.
Special Key Handling: Includes handling for special keys like Enter, Backspace, and Ctrl.
Educational Use Only: Designed to illustrate keylogging concepts and highlight ethical considerations.
Important Caution: This script is provided for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission before using any keylogging tools and adhere to all relevant legal and ethical guidelines.

This project has been a valuable learning experience in understanding keylogging and the importance of responsible use of technology.

Looking forward to more learning and growth opportunities ahead! ðŸš€ #Python #Keylogger #EthicalHacking #Programming #Learning #ProdigyInfoTech
